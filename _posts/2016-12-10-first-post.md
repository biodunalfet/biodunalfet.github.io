I've been thinking about starting a blog for quite some time now. I finally made up my mind to start one for two reasons.

<ol>
<li> I write like a toddler, only a little better. Over the last few months, I've had to prepare for some exams which involved writing some essays. To my surprise
 and disappointment, I noticed how hard it was for me to clearly express my thoughts in writing. My sentences were always too long and my writeups unharmonious. With practice, I hope I eventually master this thing.
</li>

I couldn't care less about giving speeches or what not. This year, I lost some great opportunties because my work wasn't visible enough. That is never happening again!
</li>
</ol>
