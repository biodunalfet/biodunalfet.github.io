I've been thinking about starting a blog for quite some time not. I finally made up my mind to start this blog for two reason.
1. I write like a toddler. A little better actually. Over the last few months, I've had to prepare for some exams which involved writing some essays. To my surprise
 and disappointment, I noticed I found it hard to express my thoughts clearly in writing. My sentences were always too long and my writeups ended up lacking any
  ounce of harmony. With practice, I hope I eventually master the thing.
2. This tweet by @chuiki

I couldn't care less about giving speeches or what not. This year, I lost some great opportunties because my work wasn't visible enough. That is never happening again!
